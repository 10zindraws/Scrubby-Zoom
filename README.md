A small Krita plugin that adds a new shortcut called Scrubby Zoom. It's a horizontal version of Krita's relative zoom.
I made this plugin made because I wanted horizontal zoom in Krita 5.2. While Krita 5.3 already has it as an option, that Krita version is too unstable for me to use as my daily painting program.
